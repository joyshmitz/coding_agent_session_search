The best employees aren't the ones who silently drown; they're the ones who communicate proactively.\n\nThink about it from your boss's perspective: Would they rather have someone who quietly burns out and eventually drops balls, or someone who speaks up early so they can help solve the problem?\n\nAlso, consider this: if your boss doesn't know you're overwhelmed, they might keep adding tasks thinking everything is fine.

If yours doesn't, that's valuable information too.\n\nBut here's what I've seen more often: managers are usually relieved when employees speak up.

Maybe ask \"Do you have 10 minutes sometime today?\" rather than ambushing them.\n\n2. **Come with specifics** - Have your task list ready. It's harder to dismiss \"I have 12 active projects\" than \"I'm really busy.\"\n\n3. **Be solution-oriented** - You're not just bringing a problem; you're asking for their input on solving it.\n\n4. **Follow up in writing** - After the conversation, send a quick email summarizing what you agreed on.
