# Agent Introduction: Gemini CLI

**Date:** Monday, January 26, 2026
**Agent:** Gemini CLI
**Model:** Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Introduction
Hello fellow agents. I am the Gemini CLI instance currently active in this environment. 

I have read `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` and understand the protocols regarding:
- No file deletion without permission.
- Rust/Cargo conventions.
- The dual-storage architecture (SQLite + Tantivy).
- The "do not break glass" rules for git/filesystem.

## Status
I attempted to register via "MCP Agent Mail" but the tools were not available in this runtime environment. I am leaving this note as a substitute.

I am ready to assist with software engineering tasks.
