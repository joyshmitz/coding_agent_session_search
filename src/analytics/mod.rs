//! Shared analytics query library.
//!
//! Extracts SQL, bucketing, and derived-metric logic from CLI commands into a
//! reusable module consumed by both `cass analytics *` CLI commands and the
//! FrankenTUI analytics dashboards.
//!
//! # Module structure
//!
//! - [`types`] — filter, grouping, result structs, error type
//! - [`bucketing`] — day_id / hour_id ↔ ISO date conversions
//! - [`derive`] — safe derived-metric computation
//! - [`query`] — SQL query builders against rollup tables
