// Dead-code tolerated module-wide: this storage-integrity diagnostic

#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Storage-integrity diagnostic taxonomy and JSON contract (bead
//! cass-fleet-resilience-20260608-uojcg.14.1).
//!
//! Storage failures surface today as scattered symptoms — OpenRead cursor
//! errors, integrity-check failures, stale WAL/SHM sidecars, schema-version
//! drift, busy locks, FTS metadata mismatch, legacy-DB readability problems,
//! unsafe SQL construction, and zero-result regressions — with no shared
//! vocabulary. Without one, doctor/status give generic "stale index" advice
//! when the operator actually needs archive-risk handling.
//!
//! This module defines the single contract every storage surface (health,
//! status, doctor, triage, fleet, search metadata, support bundles) projects:
//! a [`StorageState`], a [`SourceOfTruthRisk`], an [`ArchiveReadability`],
//! and the [`StorageCheck`]s attempted (each carrying `elapsed_ms`,
//! `timed_out`, an optional `skipped_reason`, and whether it is read-only).
//! [`StorageIntegrityReport::derive`] computes the source-of-truth risk from
//! the state so robot JSON and human summaries agree.
//!
//! This is the schema/contract only. The probes that populate it must use
//! bound parameters for variable SQL values and add no new rusqlite code —
//! that is the `.14.2`/`.14.3` implementation. All enums serialize as
//! snake_case, matching the readiness vocabulary; the associated root-cause
//! family reuses [`crate::root_cause_taxonomy::RootCauseFamily`].
