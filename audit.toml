    # lru 0.12.5 unsound IterMut — transitive via tantivy 0.25.0.

    # tantivy 0.25.0 only uses LruCache::{new,get,put}, never iter_mut(),
    # so the unsound code path is unreachable in practice.
    # Revisit: upgrade when tantivy 0.26+ publishes.

    # Both upstream crates use bincode for internal serialization.
    # No direct exposure in our code. No maintained drop-in replacement available
    # for these upstreams yet.
    # Revisit: check syntect and hnsw_rs releases periodically.
